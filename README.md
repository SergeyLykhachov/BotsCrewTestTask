Given project is an implementation of the speck defined in BotsCrew TestTask_JuniorJava.pdf file present in the project's
root directory (with a few caveats). Though it is proscribed that the project to be implemented as a simple console app,
this particular application interacts with its user via an intuitive and simple to use graphical interface. The project 
has been written entirely with the help of simple text editor, there exists a version of this project developed with the
help of Maven, which can be found at: https://github.com/SergeyLykhachov/BotsCrewMavenProject. Build and launch scripts
are located in the project root directory named compile and run respectively, just pick one appropriate for your operating
system. Prior to building/compiling -- bin directory needs to be created at the project root level (GitHub inconveniently
prohibits the presence of empty directories within repositories). Also, update properties/database.properties file in accordance
with your database credentials in order to be able to successfully establish connection between your database and the
application. (Note: database used in the project is MySQL). Also, an sql script named TestScript.sql is placed in the project
root folder for the purpose of database schema and sample data set initialization.

In addition, for convenience sake, two more files are present at the project root level: 
1. SQL.sql -- contains 5 sql queries pertaining to the 5 questions asked and designed database schema.
2. DB_design.png -- depicts database schema graphically.
