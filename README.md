Given project is an implementation of the speck defined in BotsCrew TestTask_JuniorJava.pdf file present in the project's
root directory (with a few caveats). Though it is proscribed that the project to be implemented as a simple console app,
this particular application interacts with its user via an intuitive and simple to use graphical interface. The project
has been written in simple text editor, the build and launch scripts are located in the project root directory named
compile and run respectively, just pick one appropriate for your operating system. Prior to building/compiling -- bin directory
needs to be at the project root level (GitHub inconveniently prohibits the presence of empty folders within repositories).
Also, update properties/database.properties file in accordance with your database credentials info in order to be able to successfully
use the project.(Note: database used in the project is MySQL).

In addition, for convenience sake, so as not having to pick through the source code, a few crucial pieces of technical knowledge
required for successful completion of this test task have been extracted into their respective files and put into project root directory.
1. SQL.sql contains 5 sql queries pertaining to the 5 questions asked in the test task pdf.
2. DB_design.png depicts database schema graphically (an online database design tool has been used to generate it).
3. Lastly, TestScript.sql file contains sql code for schema initialization and puts sample data set in tables.
