Given project is an implementation of the speck defined in BotsCrew TestTask_JuniorJava.pdf file present in the project's
root directory (with a few caveats). Though it is proscribed that the project to be implemented as a simple console app,
this particular application interacts with its user via an intuitive and simple to use graphical interface. The project
has been written in simple text editor, the build and launch scripts are located in the project root directory named
compile and run respectively, just pick one appropriate for your operating system. Prior to building/compiling -- bin directory
needs to be created at the project root level (GitHub inconveniently prohibits the presence of empty folders within repositories).
Also, update properties/database.properties file in accordance with your database credentials info in order to be able to successfully
use the project.(Note: database used in the project is MySQL).Also, an sql script named TestScript.sql is placed in the project root
folder for the purpose of database schema and sample data set initialization.

In addition, for convenience sake, two more files are present at the project root level: 
1. SQL.sql contains 5 sql queries pertaining to the 5 questions asked and chosen database schema.
2. DB_design.png depicts database schema graphically.
